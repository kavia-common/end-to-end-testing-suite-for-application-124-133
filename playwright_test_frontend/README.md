# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Playwright

This repository includes Playwright configuration to enable E2E tests without starting/stopping the preview automatically.

### Scripts
- `npm run test:e2e` — runs Playwright tests in headless mode.
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` — runs Playwright tests with a visible browser.
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` — opens the Playwright UI to run/debug tests.

### Base URL
Playwright uses `REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL` if set; otherwise it defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.  
You can also set `REACT_APP_PORT` to change the default localhost port.

### Example test
An example test lives at `tests/example.spec.ts` and verifies the home page loads and shows the "Learn React" link.

### Running tests
1. Ensure your app is reachable at the configured base URL (e.g., start it separately with `npm start` if needed).
2. Execute:  
   - `npm run test:e2e`  
   - or `npm run test:e2e:headed`  
   - or `npm run test:e2e:ui`

> Note: These commands do not manage the app lifecycle; they only execute tests against the provided base URL.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
